Changing theme:
    1. Under themes, edit the theme's json file to whatever colors you want.
    2. On vscode, go to debug (most likely you are on explorer), 
       make sure launch.json is configured correctly
    3. Start debugging (press the green run button)
    4. Now you can see live what changes you've made
    5. To check the token (what the keyword is marked as by vscode theme),
       go to command palette and type 'Developer: Inspect editor tokens and scopes'
